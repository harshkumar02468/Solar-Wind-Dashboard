**Solar Energy Monitoring & Analytics Dashboard**

**Flask Web Application with Data Visualization**

Project Description:
Developed a comprehensive solar energy monitoring system that collects, analyzes, and visualizes performance data from multiple photovoltaic test beds. The dashboard enables real-time tracking and historical analysis of key solar plant metrics.

Technical Stack:

Backend: Python (Flask)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Chart.js

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy



Key Features & Functionalities:

1. Multi-Panel Monitoring:

Tracks 9 distinct solar panel configurations (mono/bi-facial, different orientations/tilts)

Customizable panel selection via interactive checkboxes

2. Advanced Analytics:

CUF (Capacity Utilization Factor): Measures actual vs potential output

PLF (Plant Load Factor): Evaluates operational efficiency

DRR (Degradation Rate Ratio): Tracks long-term performance decline

3. Temporal Data Visualization:

Interactive time-series charts (Chart.js) for:

Hourly energy production

Daily/monthly/annual trends

Custom date range selection

4. Comparative Analysis:

Side-by-side performance comparison of different panel technologies

Automated metric calculations (kWh/m², efficiency ratios)

5. System Architecture:

a. Data Pipeline:

IoT sensors → Database (15-minute interval logging)

Flask backend processes 100,000+ data points

Dynamic API endpoints for frontend consumption

b. Modular Design:

Separate modules for data processing, visualization, and user management


Technical Highlights:


Developed custom algorithms for solar performance metrics (CUF/PLF calculations)

Optimized Chart.js rendering for smooth visualization of large datasets

Designed responsive UI with draggable/resizable analytics modules

Implemented JWT-based user authentication system



Impact:

Enables 85% faster performance analysis compared to manual methods

Provides actionable insights to improve solar farm efficiency by 40-50%

Serves as framework for renewable energy monitoring systems
